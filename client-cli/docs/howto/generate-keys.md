# Generate a key pair

Every signer needs their own key pair. This guide walks you through creating one.

## Prerequisites

- The `asfaload-cli` binary is installed and in your `PATH`.

## Steps

### 1. Choose a directory

By default the keys are generated in the **current directory**. A common convention, used throughout this guide, is to keep them together in `~/.asfaload/`:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.asfaload
```

### 2. Generate the key pair

```sh
asfaload-cli new-keys --name mykey --output-dir ~/.asfaload
```

Omit `--output-dir` to create the keys in the current directory instead.

You'll be prompted for a password to protect the secret key. Pick a strong one — this password is required every time you sign.

This creates two files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.asfaload/mykey` | Secret key (keep this safe) |
| `~/.asfaload/mykey.pub` | Public key (share with your team) |

### 3. Verify the output

```sh
ls ~/.asfaload/mykey*
```

You should see both `mykey` and `mykey.pub`.

## Non-interactive usage

For CI or scripting, pass the password directly:

```sh
asfaload-cli new-keys --name ci-key --output-dir ./keys --password "$KEY_PASSWORD"
```

Or read the password from a file with `--password-file` (`-P`):

```sh
asfaload-cli new-keys --name ci-key --output-dir ./keys --password-file /run/secrets/key-password
```

The file should contain the password on a single line. Trailing newlines are stripped.

Or fetch the password from a password manager (or any external command) with `--password-command` (`-c`). The command's standard output is used as the password:

```sh
asfaload-cli new-keys --name ci-key --output-dir ./keys \
    --password-command "pass show asfaload/ci-key"
```

The command string is parsed with shell-style quoting, but no shell is spawned — pipes and redirections don't apply. Trailing newlines are stripped from the command's output.

The password file and password command can also come from environment variables — `ASFALOAD_PASSWORD_FILE` and `ASFALOAD_PASSWORD_COMMAND`:

```sh
export ASFALOAD_PASSWORD_FILE="/run/secrets/key-password"
asfaload-cli new-keys --name ci-key --output-dir ./keys
```

The command-specific `ASFALOAD_NEW_KEYS_PASSWORD` and `ASFALOAD_NEW_KEYS_PASSWORD_FILE` are also still honoured (at lower precedence):

```sh
export ASFALOAD_NEW_KEYS_PASSWORD="$KEY_PASSWORD"
asfaload-cli new-keys --name ci-key --output-dir ./keys
```

## Next step

Share your public key with whoever maintains the signers file. Use the `share-key` command to format it — see [Share a public key](share-public-key.md). They'll include it when [creating the signers file](create-signers-file.md).
