# Share a public key

Once you have a key pair, you need to share the public key with whoever maintains the signers file. The `share-key` command formats it for you.

## Prerequisites

- A public key file (`.pub`) from [Generate a key pair](generate-keys.md).

## Steps

### 1. Print a human-readable sharing message (default)

```sh
asfaload-cli share-key -k ~/.asfaload/mykey.pub
```

This prints your public key together with a ready-to-send message you can forward to a team admin:

```
The public key is safe to share -- that's how others verify your signatures.

You can share your public key, for example with an admin, with this message:

    I have a key-pair to use with Asfaload. You can use my public
    key in signers files. Here it is:
    asfaload-pub:b5S+CxuqICIUn/DGBdMKeTMZCgQcg78ohiWQ1sC00c8
```

### 2. Print only the key with `--raw`

When you only need the base64 string — for example, to paste it into a signers file — use `--raw` (`-r`):

```sh
asfaload-cli share-key -k ~/.asfaload/mykey.pub --raw
```

Output:

```
asfaload-pub:b5S+CxuqICIUn/DGBdMKeTMZCgQcg78ohiWQ1sC00c8
```

This is the canonical base64 form used in signers files and templates.

`--raw` also works with OpenSSH ed25519 public keys — the key is normalised to its asfaload canonical form:

```sh
asfaload-cli share-key -k ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --raw
```

`--raw` and `--json` are mutually exclusive; you cannot use both at the same time.

### 3. Machine-readable JSON output

For scripting, use `--json`:

```sh
asfaload-cli share-key -k ~/.asfaload/mykey.pub --json
```

Output:

```json
{"public_key":"asfaload-pub:b5S+CxuqICIUn/DGBdMKeTMZCgQcg78ohiWQ1sC00c8","message":"The public key is safe to share -- ..."}
```

## Next step

The admin will include your public key when [creating the signers file](create-signers-file.md).
