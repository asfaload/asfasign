# About

Asfaload is an open source project delivering a generalised multi-signature sign-off solution.
It is a work in progress that will soon reach a usable state.

It aims to secure the download of artifacts from Github (and others) releases, by requiring the signature of a release by multiple
authorised parties. It provides configurable m-of-n signature thresholds to be enforced before the release of a signature is considered as complete.
