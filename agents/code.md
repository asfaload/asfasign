# CODE STYLE
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names (avoid abbreviations except very common ones)
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic, but again, explain the why, not the what.

# BEST PRACTICES
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid code duplication. Extract repeated code to functions.
- Prefer a functional approach to an object oriented approach. For example: if possible and reasonable, use iterators and avoid for loops.
- **Error Handling**: Always handle potential errors gracefully.
- **Security**: Consider security implications in your code
- **Version Control**: Write clear commit messages
